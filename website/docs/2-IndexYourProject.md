Indexing is the process of traversing your project's source files and extracting the important pieces of information such as symbols, import statements and export statements.

## Configure which folders to index

You have to tell JS Bubbles which folders it should traverse. You can add multiple folders. By default the indexer will skip `node_modules` by default.
