> A note bubble is still very experimental.

A note bubble can be added to the stage by clicking on the `+` icon on the right-hand side of the stage.

You can also `@mention` other symbols on the stage while taking note. This will in-line that particular symbol into your note bubble. You can also collapse this inlined symbol by clicking the header.
