Indexing is the process of traversing your project's source files and extracting the important pieces of information such as symbols, import statements and export statements.

### Tell which directories contains the source code

You have to tell JS Bubbles which folders it should traverse. You can add multiple folders. All the paths should be relative to the folder opened in VSCode.

<img
  alt="Directories to index"
  style={{
    border: "1px solid #f4f4f4",
    borderRadius: "3px",
    maxWidth: "500px"
  }}
  src={useBaseUrl("img/directories-to-index.png")}
/>

By default the indexer will skip `node_modules`.

### Configure path alias

If you use [`resolve.alias`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) of Webpack or a similar feature of another build tool, you should configure those paths in the preference.

<img
  alt="Directories to index"
  style={{
    border: "1px solid #f4f4f4",
    borderRadius: "3px",
    maxWidth: "500px"
  }}
  src={useBaseUrl("img/path-alias.png")}
/>

For example if you have a path alias `app` points to a directory `./src/view/app` in your project, the `Alias` text box should be `app` and the `Path` text box should be `./src/view/app`.

### Start indexing

Once you have your configurations in place, click the "Start Indexing" button. This might take a few seconds or minutes depending on the number of files in your project.
