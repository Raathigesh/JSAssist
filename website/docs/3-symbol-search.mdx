JSBubbles indexes your source code so it comes with a fast symbol search. You can open the symbol search window by pressing `ctrl + f`. Once your select a symbol from the search results, the symbol bubble will be added to the stage.

You can also open other connected symbols by clicking the markers on your current symbol. This feature is documented separately in the `Symbol bubble` section.

### Search filters

If you want to filter symbols by type, you can use the following search filters.

- You can filter only `Function` symbols by searching `func <search query>` (e.g: `func addItem`)
- You can filter only `Variable` symbols by searching `var <search query>` (e.g: `var items`)
- You can filter only `Class` symbols by searching `class <search query>` (e.g: `class ViewComponent`)
- You can filter only `Type` symbols by searching `type <search query>` (e.g: `type Item`)
