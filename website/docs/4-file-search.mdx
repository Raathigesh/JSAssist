You can open the file search window by pressing `ctrl + shift + f`. Search for the file you are looking for by path and either click on it or hit `enter` to add it to the stage.

The file bubble on the stage displays the outline of the file. You can move the file bubble around by clicking and dragging the bubble header. Clicking on any of the symbol in the file bubble will open a symbol bubble.
