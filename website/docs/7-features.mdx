import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Type your search query in the search box to search for matching symbols in your code-base. You can also apply filters such as `functions`, `classes` or `types` to narrow your search by typing the `/` character.

<video
    loop={true}
    autoPlay={true}
    muted={true}
    alt="Docusaurus with Keytar"
    src={useBaseUrl('videos/search.mp4')}
    width="100%"
/>

## Searching symbols only in certain files

For example the query `getType src/view/items` will search the symbols with `getType` in the folder `src/view/items`. The key is to separate the search query with a `space`.

## Copying import statement

You can copy import statement of a symbol by clicking the copy button in the search results. If you are using module alias, having the [module alias correctly configured](/docs/alias-configuration) will let you get the correct import paths.
