## JSBubbles

JSBubbles is a VSCode extension which makes it easy to find and read JavaScript without switching back and forth between multiple files.

JSBubbles is inspired by [Code bubbles](http://www.andrewbragdon.com/codebubbles_site.asp) and few ideas of [the Light table IDE](https://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table-a-new-ide-concept/).
