#### Configure and index your project

- When you open the extension, you will be prompted to configure and index your project.
- Click on "Configure project" to open the Preference panel.
  - You have to add which folders to index
  - Also, if you use path alias (like Webpack's resolve rules), make sure to add those as well.
- Then go ahead and click **"Start Indexing"**. This will take a few minutes.
